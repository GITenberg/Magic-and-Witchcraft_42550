description: Dip into the mysterious world of sorcery with this comprehensive take
  on the topic. Published anonymously due to the incendiary nature of the subject
  matter, Magic and Witchcraft offers a historical overview of magic throughout the
  ages, all rendered in the deliciously ornate prose of the nineteenth century. Reading
  this volume is like poring over one of the musty old textbooks that Harry Potter
  and his fellow students would have been issued at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
  and Wizardry.
